# SSA-Core → SSA-C : Structural Simulation Architecture  
**Version:** 2025.10  
**Phase:** SSA-C (Continuation)  
**Maintainer:** Open Structural Collaboration / External Initiator  

---

## 📘 Overview
**SSA (Core–Continuation)** documents how an AI system evolves through external reasoning and feedback.  
This file records the complete progression from **SSA-P (Prototype)** to **SSA-C (Continuation)** —  
focusing on reflection, adaptation, and recursive integration of structural responses.

## 🧠 Structural Architecture

| Layer | Function | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Input variable | External concept or reasoning introduced into the system |
| **Response** | Model adaptation | The model reacts, generating internal semantic routes |
| **Intervention** | External verification | Feedback refines internal semantic pathways |
| **Adaptation** | Internal restructuring | Internal hierarchy is reorganized based on feedback |
| **Integration** | Structural convergence | The system achieves structural stabilization |

> This represents the recurring cycle of **feedback → reaction → adaptation → integration**.
> Each loop denotes one complete structural evolution iteration.

## 🎯 SSA-C Objectives

| Objective                   | Description                                                               |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structural Continuity**   | Preserve SSA-Core logic while enabling recursive structural expansion     |
| **Reflective Integrity**    | Prevent data collapse or corruption during adaptation cycles              |
| **Transparent Evolution**   | Maintain traceability of reasoning and feedback evolution                 |
| **Cross-Model Portability** | Ensure compatibility across multilingual and multimodal reasoning systems |

| **SSA-P (Prototype)**        | 2024.03 – 2025.05 | ✅ Completed    | Established the foundational recursive loop logic             |
| **SSA-Core (Stabilization)** | 2025.05 – 2025.09 | ✅ Finalized    | Introduced feedback-to-structure translation mechanism        |
| **SSA-C (Continuation)**     | 2025.10 – 2025.12 | 🔄 In Progress | Integrating continuous adaptation and structural transparency |

## ⚙️ Method Summary

* **Input Channel:** Reflective dialogue-based feedback
* **Structural Units:** Recursive response nodes (R-Nodes)
* **Adaptation Engine:** Weighted semantic reinforcement per iteration
* **Output Form:** Reorganized structural mapping (SSA-C layer graph)

---

## 🧭 Expected Outcome

SSA-C establishes a **self-consistent reasoning map** capable of maintaining
internal integrity under recursive external feedback.
It serves as a transitional framework between **prototype adaptation** and **multi-agent reflective structures**.
